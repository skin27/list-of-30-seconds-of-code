# list of 30 seconds of code

First started for Javascript, a project to collect useful pieces of code (aka snippets). All these snippets have in
common that any programmer can understand the code in 30 seconds (or less!).

There are now are many new initiatives to collect snippets for other programming languages. 
Here is a curated list of code snippets lists.
